# echo3D React Components

This package contains helpful React components designed to work with the echo3D platform API. 

## Using the package

1. Install via `npm i echo3d`:

2. Importing `<model-viewer/>`:

If your framework does not utilize server side rendering: run `npm i @google/model-viewer` and add `import '@google/model-viewer'` to any files that utilize `<Echo/>`  

If your framework does utilize server side rendering: [Issues arise](https://github.com/google/model-viewer/issues/690) when components or pages importing `model-viewer` are rendered server side. To most reliably resolve this issue for SSR apps, provide the `model-viewer` via a script element in your `_document` file eg:
`<script type="module" src="https://unpkg.com/@google/model-viewer/dist/model-viewer.min.js"></script>`

3. (Only for typescript apps) If you do not have a `globals.d.ts` file, create one within your app `src` folder, add the line `declare module 'echo3d';` and save the file to resolve compiler typing errors.


## `<Echo/>` Model Viewer Component

This very young package currently contains only one component, a 3D model viewer built using [google model-viewer](https://modelviewer.dev/). This component can be configured with an `apiKey` and `entryID` to stream and display models from the echo3D platform as well as a direct `src` url to display local or cloud files. Common `<model-viewer/>` configuration parameters are also exposed. 

### Required Parameters
You must provide `src` or both `apiKey` and `entryID`.

  `src`: Element will make no query and pass this url directly to <model-viewer/>

  `apiKey`: Your echo3D project apiKey, eg some-words-1234

  `entryID`: The entry ID of the hologram you would like to display

### Optional Parameters

  `className`: The CSS classes that will be applied to the element. If no classes are provided, the component will default to a 600px height viewer.

  `securityKey`: provide your security key if it is enabled for your project

  `disableZoom`: When defined, disables zoom (camera controls must be enabled)

  `cameraOrbit`: The starting focal point of the viewer

  `cameraControls`: When defined, camera controls for the viewer are disabled

  `autoRotate`: When defined, automatic rotation of the model is disabled

  `tapToCenter`: When defined, tap-to-recenter behavior is enabled
